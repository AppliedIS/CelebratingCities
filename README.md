# Celebrating Cities – Hack the Last Mile: ![RideHUB](/src/mobile/www/img/logo-ridehub.png)

This application is designed to help low-income residents, in underserved areas, find access to affordable transportation. RideHUB will simultaneously provide the DOT, along with state and local governments, data that can help determine where public transit options are most needed.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for both Problem Set 1 – Challenge 1 (Tom's vignette): Catalyze neighborhood revitalization in underserved areas, and Problem Set 2 – Challenge 1 (Janice's vignette): serving last-mile mobility. To satisfy this approach we:

- Collected and studied data from multiple agencies
- Studied the datasets to identify pockets of underserved, low-income families that lacked access to affordable transportation.
  - Though our app was designed to allow the people of the communities to get to where they needed to be we quickly discovered there was a much wider use-case available.
- Developed an application that allows users to create HUBs where multiple riders can gather, either on a consistent schedule or for ad-hoc events, and take advantage of the cost sharing option for Uber.

We are presenting this app, along with suggestions for possible use cases, to Uber and DOT.
